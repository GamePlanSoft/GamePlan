GamePlan version 4 was developped using Delphi 4. 
It allows the user to create games of extensive, normal, and graph forms 
(i.e. stochastic and repeated games) and solve them using the relevant 
Nash, subgame perfect, Markov perfect or perfect bayesian equilibrium concepts.
The objective of this project is to maintain and develop GamePlan further.
This may first involve using the more recent Delphi 10-11 versions of the compiler.
It may also involve recompiling for operating systems other than Windows.
